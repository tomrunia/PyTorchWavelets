        The standard version::

            pi**-0.25 * exp(1j*w*x) * exp(-0.5*(x**2))

        This commonly used wavelet is often referred to simply as the
        Morlet wavelet.  Note that this simplified version can cause
        admissibility problems at low values of `w`.

        The complete version::

            pi**-0.25 * (exp(1j*w*x) - exp(-0.5*(w**2))) * exp(-0.5*(x**2))

        The complete version of the Morlet wavelet, with a correction
        term to improve admissibility. For `w` greater than 5, the
        correction term is negligible.

        Note that the energy of the return wavelet is not normalised
        according to `s`.

        The fundamental frequency of this wavelet in Hz is given
        by ``f = 2*s*w*r / M`` where r is the sampling rate.
